**Classic Snake Game**
This repository contains a classic Snake game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project demonstrates how to create a simple yet engaging game with separate files for the HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic. It supports both keyboard controls and touch gestures, making it playable on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Features**'\n'
Canvas-based Game: The game is played on an HTML canvas element, allowing for dynamic rendering of the game board, snake, and food.
Separate Files: The code is organized into separate files for HTML (index.html), CSS (style.css), and JavaScript (script.js) for improved maintainability and clarity.
Keyboard and Touch Controls: The game supports arrow key controls for desktop players and touch gestures for mobile users. Players can swipe up, down, left, or right to change the direction of the snake.
Randomized Food Placement: The food is placed at random locations on the game board to keep the game challenging and engaging.
Game Over Detection: The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself, displaying a game over message on the screen.
Restart Functionality: Players can restart the game by pressing the Enter key or tapping on the game over message.
